## Reverse Engineering

> My friend's computer recently got infected by some malware and all he has now are the encrypted files

### Files
- nobmalware.zip

### Analysis
Unzip nobmalware.zip and analyse malware.py
The code opens every file in the current directory and shifts its bytes by 2

malware.py
```python
import os

shift = 2
newdata = ""
for file_name in os.listdir():
    data = open(file_name, 'rb').read()
    
    for i in data:
        newdata+=chr(i+shift)
    enc = open(file_name + '.enc', 'w')
    enc.write(newdata)
```

### Solution
1. Change the shift to -2 and run the code again
2. Remove the .enc extension
