# nob malware
## Reverse Engineering

> My friend's computer recently got infected by some malware and all he has now are the encrypted files

### Files
- nobmalware.zip

### Analysis
Unzip nobmalware.zip and analyse malware.py
The code opens every file in the current directory and shifts its bytes by 2

### Solution
1. Change the shift to -2 and run the code again
2. Remove the .enc extension
